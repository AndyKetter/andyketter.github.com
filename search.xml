      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.(If you’re looking for a WordPress framework, check out Redux Framework.) It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger. You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library.It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies). Learn Redux from its creator:Part 1: Getting Started with Redux (30 free videos)Part 2: Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux (27 free videos) Testimonials “Love what you’re doing with Redux”Jing Chen, creator of Flux “I asked for comments on Redux in FB’s internal JS discussion group, and it was universally praised. Really awesome work.”Bill Fisher, author of Flux documentation “It’s cool that you are inventing a better Flux by not doing Flux at all.”André Staltz, creator of Cycle Before Proceeding Further Also read:You Might Not Need Redux Developer ExperienceI wrote Redux while working on my React Europe talk called “Hot Reloading with Time Travel”. My goal was to create a state management library with minimal API but completely predictable behavior, so it is possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer. InfluencesRedux evolves the ideas of Flux, but avoids its complexity by taking cues from Elm.Whether you have used them or not, Redux only takes a few minutes to get started with. InstallationTo install the stable version: 1npm install --save redux This assumes you are using npm as your package manager. If you’re not, you can access these files on unpkg, download them, or point your package manager to them. Most commonly people consume Redux as a collection of CommonJS modules. These modules are what you get when you import redux in a Webpack, Browserify, or a Node environment. If you like to live on the edge and use Rollup, we support that as well. If you don’t use a module bundler, it’s also fine. The redux npm package includes precompiled production and development UMD builds in the dist folder. They can be used directly without a bundler and are thus compatible with many popular JavaScript module loaders and environments. For example, you can drop a UMD build as a &lt;script&gt; tag on the page, or tell Bower to install it. The UMD builds make Redux available as a window.Redux global variable. The Redux source code is written in ES2015 but we precompile both CommonJS and UMD builds to ES5 so they work in any modern browser. You don’t need to use Babel or a module bundler to get started with Redux. Complementary PackagesMost likely, you’ll also need the React bindings and the developer tools. 12npm install --save react-reduxnpm install --save-dev redux-devtools Note that unlike Redux itself, many packages in the Redux ecosystem don’t provide UMD builds, so we recommend using CommonJS module bundlers like Webpack and Browserify for the most comfortable development experience. The GistThe whole state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single store.The only way to change the state tree is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.To specify how the actions transform the state tree, you write pure reducers. That’s it! 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445import &#123; createStore &#125; from 'redux'/** * This is a reducer, a pure function with (state, action) =&gt; state signature. * It describes how an action transforms the state into the next state. * * The shape of the state is up to you: it can be a primitive, an array, an object, * or even an Immutable.js data structure. The only important part is that you should * not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes. * * In this example, we use a `switch` statement and strings, but you can use a helper that * follows a different convention (such as function maps) if it makes sense for your * project. */function counter(state = 0, action) &#123; switch (action.type) &#123; case 'INCREMENT': return state + 1 case 'DECREMENT': return state - 1 default: return state &#125;&#125;// Create a Redux store holding the state of your app.// Its API is &#123; subscribe, dispatch, getState &#125;.let store = createStore(counter)// You can use subscribe() to update the UI in response to state changes.// Normally you'd use a view binding library (e.g. React Redux) rather than subscribe() directly.// However it can also be handy to persist the current state in the localStorage.store.subscribe(() =&gt; console.log(store.getState()))// The only way to mutate the internal state is to dispatch an action.// The actions can be serialized, logged or stored and later replayed.store.dispatch(&#123; type: 'INCREMENT' &#125;)// 1store.dispatch(&#123; type: 'INCREMENT' &#125;)// 2store.dispatch(&#123; type: 'DECREMENT' &#125;)// 1 Instead of mutating the state directly, you specify the mutations you want to happen with plain objects called actions. Then you write a special function called a reducer to decide how every action transforms the entire application’s state. If you’re coming from Flux, there is a single important difference you need to understand. Redux doesn’t have a Dispatcher or support many stores. Instead, there is just a single store with a single root reducing function. As your app grows, instead of adding stores, you split the root reducer into smaller reducers independently operating on the different parts of the state tree. This is exactly like how there is just one root component in a React app, but it is composed out of many small components. This architecture might seem like an overkill for a counter app, but the beauty of this pattern is how well it scales to large and complex apps. It also enables very powerful developer tools, because it is possible to trace every mutation to the action that caused it. You can record user sessions and reproduce them just by replaying every action. Learn Redux from Its CreatorGetting Started with Redux is a video course consisting of 30 videos narrated by Dan Abramov, author of Redux. It is designed to complement the “Basics” part of the docs while bringing additional insights about immutability, testing, Redux best practices, and using Redux with React. This course is free and will always be. “Great course on egghead.io by @dan_abramov - instead of just showing you how to use #redux, it also shows how and why redux was built!”Sandrino Di Mattia “Plowing through @dan_abramov ‘Getting Started with Redux’ - its amazing how much simpler concepts get with video.”Chris Dhanaraj “This video series on Redux by @dan_abramov on @eggheadio is spectacular!”Eddie Zaneski “Come for the name hype. Stay for the rock solid fundamentals. (Thanks, and great job @dan_abramov and @eggheadio!)”Dan “This series of videos on Redux by @dan_abramov is repeatedly blowing my mind - gunna do some serious refactoring”Laurence Roberts So, what are you waiting for? Watch the 30 Free Videos!If you enjoyed my course, consider supporting Egghead by buying a subscription. Subscribers have access to the source code for the example in every one of my videos, as well as to tons of advanced lessons on other topics, including JavaScript in depth, React, Angular, and more.

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[React &middot; React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Declarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug. Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM. Learn Once, Write Anywhere: We don’t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native. Learn how to use React in your own project. ExamplesWe have several examples on the website. Here is the first one to get you started: 12345678910class HelloMessage extends React.Component &#123; render() &#123; return &lt;div&gt;Hello &#123;this.props.name&#125;&lt;/div&gt;; &#125;&#125;ReactDOM.render( &lt;HelloMessage name="John" /&gt;, document.getElementById('container')); This example will render “Hello John” into a container on the page. You’ll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; we call it JSX. JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. We recommend using Babel with a React preset to convert JSX into native JavaScript for browsers to digest. InstallationReact is available as the react package on npm. It is also available on a CDN. React is flexible and can be used in a variety of projects. You can create new apps with it, but you can also gradually introduce it into an existing codebase without doing a rewrite. The recommended way to install React depends on your project.

      <title><![CDATA[React-router-redux]]></title>
      <url>%2F2017%2F02%2F19%2FReact-router-redux%2F</url>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[react-router-redux Keep your router in sync with application state :sparkles: Formerly known as redux-simple-router You’re a smart person. You use Redux to manage your application state. You use React Router to do routing. All is good. But the two libraries don’t coordinate. You want to do time travel with your application state, but React Router doesn’t navigate between pages when you replay actions. It controls an important part of application state: the URL. This library helps you keep that bit of state in sync with your Redux store. We keep a copy of the current location hidden in state. When you rewind your application state with a tool like Redux DevTools, that state change is propagated to React Router so it can adjust the component tree accordingly. You can jump around in state, rewinding, replaying, and resetting as much as you’d like, and this library will ensure the two stay in sync at all times. This library is not necessary for using Redux together with React Router. You can use the two together just fine without any additional libraries. It is useful if you care about recording, persisting, and replaying user actions, using time travel. If you don’t care about these features, just use Redux and React Router directly. Installation1npm install --save react-router-redux How It WorksThis library allows you to use React Router’s APIs as they are documented. And, you can use redux like you normally would, with a single app state. The library simply enhances a history instance to allow it to synchronize any changes it receives into application state. history + store (redux) &rarr; react-router-redux &rarr; enhanced history &rarr; react-router TutorialLet’s take a look at a simple example. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132import React from 'react'import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'import &#123; createStore, combineReducers &#125; from 'redux'import &#123; Provider &#125; from 'react-redux'import &#123; Router, Route, browserHistory &#125; from 'react-router'import &#123; syncHistoryWithStore, routerReducer &#125; from 'react-router-redux'import reducers from '&lt;project-path&gt;/reducers'// Add the reducer to your store on the `routing` keyconst store = createStore( combineReducers(&#123; ...reducers, routing: routerReducer &#125;))// Create an enhanced history that syncs navigation events with the storeconst history = syncHistoryWithStore(browserHistory, store)ReactDOM.render( &lt;Provider store=&#123;store&#125;&gt; &#123; /* Tell the Router to use our enhanced history */ &#125; &lt;Router history=&#123;history&#125;&gt; &lt;Route path="/" component=&#123;App&#125;&gt; &lt;Route path="foo" component=&#123;Foo&#125;/&gt; &lt;Route path="bar" component=&#123;Bar&#125;/&gt; &lt;/Route&gt; &lt;/Router&gt; &lt;/Provider&gt;, document.getElementById('mount')) Now any time you navigate, which can come from pressing browser buttons or navigating in your application code, the enhanced history will first pass the new location through the Redux store and then on to React Router to update the component tree. If you time travel, it will also pass the new state to React Router to update the component tree again. How do I watch for navigation events, such as for analytics?Simply listen to the enhanced history via history.listen. This takes in a function that will receive a location any time the store updates. This includes any time travel activity performed on the store. 123const history = syncHistoryWithStore(browserHistory, store)history.listen(location =&gt; analyticsService.track(location.pathname)) For other kinds of events in your system, you can use middleware on your Redux store like normal to watch any action that is dispatched to the store. What if I use Immutable.js or another state wrapper with my Redux store?When using a wrapper for your store’s state, such as Immutable.js, you will need to change two things from the standard setup: By default, the library expects to find the history state at state.routing. If your wrapper prevents accessing properties directly, or you want to put the routing state elsewhere, pass a selector function to access the historystate via the selectLocationState option on syncHistoryWithStore. Provide your own reducer function that will receive actions of type LOCATION_CHANGE and return the payload merged into the locationBeforeTransitions property of the routing state. For example, state.set(&quot;routing&quot;, {locationBeforeTransitions: action.payload}). These two hooks will allow you to store the state that this library uses in whatever format or wrapper you would like. How do I access router state in a container component?React Router provides route information via a route component’s props. This makes it easy to access them from a container component. When using react-redux to connect() your components to state, you can access the router’s props from the 2nd argument of mapStateToProps: 123456function mapStateToProps(state, ownProps) &#123; return &#123; id: ownProps.params.id, filter: ownProps.location.query.filter &#125;;&#125; You should not read the location state directly from the Redux store. This is because React Router operates asynchronously (to handle things such as dynamically-loaded components) and your component tree may not yet be updated in sync with your Redux state. You should rely on the props passed by React Router, as they are only updated after it has processed all asynchronous code. What if I want to issue navigation events via Redux actions?React Router provides singleton versions of history (browserHistory and hashHistory) that you can import and use from anywhere in your application. However, if you prefer Redux style actions, the library also provides a set of action creators and a middleware to capture them and redirect them to your history instance. 123456789101112import &#123; createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware &#125; from 'redux';import &#123; routerMiddleware, push &#125; from 'react-router-redux'// Apply the middleware to the storeconst middleware = routerMiddleware(browserHistory)const store = createStore( reducers, applyMiddleware(middleware))// Dispatch from anywhere like normal.store.dispatch(push('/foo')) Examples examples/basic - basic reference implementation Examples from the community: shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial - react-router-redux including Server Rendering using React on Rails, live at www.reactrails.com. davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit - popular redux starter kit tip: migrating from react-router-redux ^3.0.0? use this commit as a reference svrcekmichal/universal-react - Universal react app with async actions provided by svrcekmichal/reasync package steveniseki/react-router-redux-example - minimal react-router-redux example includes css modules and universal rendering choonkending/react-webpack-node - Full-stack universal Redux App kuy/treemap-with-router - An example for react-router-redux with d3’s treemap. &rarr; Have an example to add? Send us a PR! &larr; APIrouterReducer()You must add this reducer to your store for syncing to work. A reducer function that stores location updates from history. If you use combineReducers, it should be nested under the routing key. history = syncHistoryWithStore(history, store, [options])Creates an enhanced history from the provided history. This history changes history.listen to pass all location updates through the provided store first. This ensures if the store is updated either from a navigation event or from a time travel action, such as a replay, the listeners of the enhanced history will stay in sync. You must provide the enhanced history to your &lt;Router&gt; component. This ensures your routes stay in sync with your location and your store at the same time. The options object takes in the following optional keys: selectLocationState - (default state =&gt; state.routing) A selector function to obtain the history state from your store. Useful when not using the provided routerReducer to store history state. Allows you to use wrappers, such as Immutable.js. adjustUrlOnReplay - (default true) When false, the URL will not be kept in sync during time travel. This is useful when using persistState from Redux DevTools and not wanting to maintain the URL state when restoring state. push(location), replace(location), go(number), goBack(), goForward()You must install routerMiddleware for these action creators to work. Action creators that correspond with the [history methods of the same name](https://github.com/mjackson/history/blob/master/README.md#navigation). For reference they are defined as follows: push - Pushes a new location to history, becoming the current location. replace - Replaces the current location in history. go - Moves backwards or forwards a relative number of locations in history. goForward - Moves forward one location. Equivalent to go(1) goBack - Moves backwards one location. Equivalent to go(-1) Both push and replace take in a location descriptor, which can be an object describing the URL or a plain string URL. These action creators are also available in one single object as routerActions, which can be used as a convenience when using Redux’s bindActionCreators(). routerMiddleware(history)A middleware you can apply to your Redux store to capture dispatched actions created by the action creators. It will redirect those actions to the provided history instance. LOCATION_CHANGEAn action type that you can listen for in your reducers to be notified of route updates. Fires after any changes to history.]]></content>
